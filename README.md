# Dark Heresy 2e Dice App

Dice roller app for the Dark Heresy 2e TTRPG. Should also work for the other Fantasy Flight Games RPGs that use the d100 DOS system.

Allows for quick DOS calculations and tracks roll averages so you can show your friends how unlucky you are with statistics to prove it. There is also the option to supply a group ID so you can compare your stats with everyone using the same ID.
